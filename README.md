## Potential improvements 
Unfortunately I could not impliment all the functionality that I wanted, and had to cut some corners to due to time constraints.  Below are some of the things i would've liked to change/ improve on
### Hooks
My first improvement would be to add hooks. Although classes work, react hooks look cleaner and more code bases use it. Although react hooks are simpler I was able to solve the exercise quicker and with less issues because of my own familiarity. 

### Data Manipulation 
I would have loved to impliment a dropdown that lets users change the displayed data.  I could have implimented a Inertion sort algortithm that would orginize the given objects alphabetical order. 
### Tests 
I ran into some issues with testing and unfortunately a lot of my time was spent on it. I am going to keep plugging away at this and hopfully will have an answer for you in the future. I added the code in my submission  in a seperate branch for you to take a look at despite it not working.
